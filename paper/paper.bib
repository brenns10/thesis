Hence, it solves the identified performance problems with LIA while retaining non-flappiness and responsiveness behavior of LIA, as shown by different studies [5, 6, 7, 8].

The current congestion control algorithm of MPTCP, LIA, achieves only course- grained load balancing, since it is based on packet loss event. On the contrary, wVegas adopts packet queuing delay as congestion signals, thus achieving fine-grained load balancing. Compared with loss-based algorithms, wVegas is more sensitive to the changes of network congestion and thus achieves more timely traffic shifting and quicker convergence. WVegas has been implemented in the Linux Kernel and is part of the UCLouvain&#39;s MPTCP implementation now.},

Network-Assisted MPTCP deployment models are designed to facilitate the adoption of MPTCP for the establishment of multi-path communications without making any assumption about the support of MPTCP by the communicating peers. MCPs located in the network are responsible for establishing multi-path communications on behalf of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities to achieve different goals that include (but are not limited to) optimization of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of resiliency (e.g., primary/backup communication paths), and traffic offload management.

A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based. SR allows to enforce a flow through any path (topological, or application/service based) while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the SR domain. Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane with the addition of a new type of Routing Extension Header. This draft describes the Segment Routing Extension Header Type and how it is used by SR capable nodes.},
