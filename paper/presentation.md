Timeline
--------

According to Misha, the talk portion of the defense runs about 50 minutes.
Here's a rough breakdown of how much time I want to spend on each section:

- Introduction + Background (5 minutes)
  - they will not be separate sections
- Related work (10 minutes)
- Mechanism (20 minutes)
- Evaluation (10 minutes)
- Conclusion (5 minutes)
