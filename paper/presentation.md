According to Misha, the talk portion of the defense runs about 50 minutes.
Here's a rough breakdown of how much time I want to spend on each section:

- Introduction (7 minutes)
- Background (8 minutes)
- Related work (5 minutes)
- Mechanism (18 minutes)
- Evaluation (7 minutes)
- Conclusion (5 minutes)
