Thesis
======

This repository holds all the work for my Master's thesis, including code,
references, documentation, and of course the thesis itself.

Overview
--------

The goal of this project is to create a system which can allow users to improve
the reliability of a connection by using MPTCP to tunnel the connection through
another detour point.

Documentation
-------------

I've discovered that there is no way to complete this project without lots of
documentation about how to do the things I'm doing. Therefore I'm always
maintaining a directory full of documentation.  [Here](doc/) is the root
of that documentation.
